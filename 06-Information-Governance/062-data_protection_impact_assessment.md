# 1. Purpose of Assessment

This Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) evaluates the privacy and security risks associated with the Trust's **Patient Portal and Healthcare Interoperability Platform**.

The assessment has been completed to ensure that:

- Patient information is processed lawfully and securely.
- Privacy risks are identified and mitigated.
- Security controls are appropriate for sensitive healthcare data.
- The Trust can demonstrate compliance with UK GDPR requirements.

# 2. Project Overview

## Solution Description

The Trust operates a digital patient platform that allows patients to:

- View appointments.
- Access selected medical information.
- Receive healthcare messages.
- Communicate with healthcare teams.
- Access digital healthcare services.

The platform integrates with internal Trust systems through healthcare interoperability services using APIs.

The platform exchanges information with:

- Electronic Patient Record (EPR).
- Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Radiology Information System (RIS).
- Pharmacy systems.
- External healthcare providers.

---

# 3. DPIA Trigger

A DPIA is required because the solution involves:

- Processing of special category health data.
- Large-scale processing of patient information.
- Digital access to confidential medical records.
- Automated data exchange between multiple systems.
- External user access.
- Cloud-based processing.

---

# 6. Special Category Data

The solution processes special category data including:

- Medical history.
- Physical and mental health information.
- Medication information.
- Diagnostic results.
- Treatment information.

Under UK GDPR, health information requires enhanced protection due to the potential harm caused by unauthorised disclosure.


# 7. Purpose of Processing

The Trust processes patient information to:

- Provide healthcare services.
- Support clinical decision-making.
- Improve patient access to services.
- Enable digital communication.
- Improve healthcare coordination.
- Support patient safety.


# 8. Lawful Basis for Processing

| Processing Activity | Lawful Basis |
|---|---|
| Delivery of healthcare services | Public task |
| Management of patient records | Legal obligation / public task |
| Provision of digital patient services | Public task |
| Processing health information | Provision of healthcare and management of health systems |
| Service improvement activities | Public interest |


# 9. Data Flow Overview

The Patient Portal and Healthcare Interoperability Platform enables patients, clinicians, and authorised healthcare partners to securely exchange healthcare information. The data flow represents how patient information moves between external users, digital services, clinical systems, and supporting security controls.

This diagram, and the accompanying trust boundary model, have been extracted into standalone, colour-coded files so they can be referenced from both this DPIA and [063-data_lineage_assessment](063-data_lineage_assessment.md) without duplication:

- [Data_Flow_Diagrams/001-patient_portal_data_flow](Data_Flow_Diagrams/001-patient_portal_data_flow.md) — full system data flow (patient, portal, API gateway, FHIR layer, clinical systems, security monitoring)
- [Data_Flow_Diagrams/002-patient_portal_trust_boundary](Data_Flow_Diagrams/002-patient_portal_trust_boundary.md) — simplified security trust boundary model, useful for DPIA, CAF A2/A3, ISO 27001, and STRIDE threat modelling
