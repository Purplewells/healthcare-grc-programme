# Business Continuity Plan

**Organisation:** Westbridge Hospitals Trust (WHT)
**Document Type:** Business Continuity Plan
**Owner:** Business Continuity Manager
**Classification:** Portfolio Case Study – Fictional Organisation
**Version:** 1.0



# 1. Purpose

This plan sets out how WHT maintains and recovers delivery of its critical clinical and corporate services when a disruptive incident — cyber or otherwise — prevents normal operation. It is the document already cited as existing evidence in [../03-Current-State-Assessment/022-caf_assessment](../03-Current-State-Assessment/022-caf_assessment.md) §4.4 (CAF Objective D) and §9 (REC-006), and closes the gap previously tracked in `../NAVIGATION.md`'s Known Cross-Reference Gap note. This plan addresses **continuity of service** — keeping clinical and corporate functions running, including by manual or degraded means; technical restoration of IT systems and data is addressed in the companion [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md).



# 2. Scope

This plan covers WHT's acute hospital sites and community healthcare centres described in [../01-Discovery/002-organisation_profile](../01-Discovery/002-organisation_profile.md) §2, and applies to disruption of any Critical or High-rated asset in the [master assets register](../02-Asset-Management/022-master_assets_register.xlsx). It covers cyber-originated disruption (ransomware, systems outage, data loss), and non-cyber disruption (power, facilities, third-party/utility failure) where the response depends on the same continuity structures. It does not cover the technical incident response process itself, which is addressed in [../08-Incident-Management/081-incident_response_plan](../08-Incident-Management/081-incident_response_plan.md), or technical system/data restoration, which is addressed in [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md) — this plan governs the handoff between those two and the continuity of patient-facing and corporate services while they are underway.



# 3. Business Impact Analysis

Service tiers are derived from the Critical/High asset ratings in the [critical assets register](../02-Asset-Management/026-critical_assets_register.xlsx) and the asset groupings in [021-digital_asset_estate](../02-Asset-Management/021-digital_asset_estate.md). Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption (MTPD) reflects patient safety impact, not just operational inconvenience.

| Tier | Service / Underpinning Asset | MTPD | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Life-critical clinical | Electronic Patient Record (AST-001), Patient Monitoring Devices (AST-021), Pharmacy Management System (AST-005) | 4 hours | Direct, immediate patient safety impact; clinical staff cannot safely prescribe, administer, or monitor without a fallback |
| 2 — Diagnostic and treatment-critical | Laboratory Information System (AST-002), Radiology Information System (AST-003), PACS (AST-004), Radiology Imaging Devices (AST-020), Laboratory Analysis Equipment (AST-022) | 24 hours | Delays diagnosis and treatment decisions; urgent/emergency cases can be redirected short-term, elective activity cannot continue at pace |
| 3 — Enabling infrastructure | Core Network Infrastructure (AST-015), On-Premises Data Centres (AST-016), Azure Cloud Environment (AST-017), Microsoft Entra ID (AST-029) | 4–24 hours (inherits the shortest MTPD of any Tier 1/2 service it underpins) | Underpins every Tier 1 and Tier 2 service; its own MTPD cannot be longer than theirs |
| 4 — National/external dependency | NHS Digital Services — Spine, PDS, e-Referral (AST-032) | 24 hours | Outside WHT's control to restore, but affects patient identification, referral, and cross-organisation data sharing |
| 5 — Corporate/administrative | Administrative and back-office systems | 72 hours | Operationally important but no direct patient safety impact in the short term |

This tiering deliberately does not assume IT recovery will meet these windows — [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md) §3 sets the RTO/RPO targets IT recovery is working toward, and REC-003 in [022-caf_assessment](../03-Current-State-Assessment/022-caf_assessment.md) §9 records that a recurring test schedule to validate those targets is not yet established. Where IT recovery cannot meet a Tier 1/2 MTPD, §4's manual continuity arrangements are what actually protects patients, not a recovery time assumption.



# 4. Continuity Strategies by Service Tier

| Tier | Continuity Strategy |
|---|---|
| 1 — Life-critical clinical | Paper-based clinical downtime procedures (drug charts, observation charts, prescribing) already familiar to clinical staff through routine local IT maintenance; Clinical Safety Officer confirms safe-to-continue status; elective activity at the affected site is paused before emergency/inpatient care is affected |
| 2 — Diagnostic and treatment-critical | Manual result recording and courier-based sample/result transfer between sites; mutual aid between WHT's two acute sites where only one is affected; urgent cases triaged to the unaffected site or to network partner organisations under existing clinical referral arrangements |
| 3 — Enabling infrastructure | Failover to secondary infrastructure where technically available (see [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md) §4); network segmentation ([../09-Security-Operations/093-secure_baseline](../09-Security-Operations/093-secure_baseline.md) §5) limits the blast radius of a single infrastructure failure |
| 4 — National/external dependency | Local fallback identification and referral processes; incident logged with NHS Digital service desk; WHT cannot independently restore this tier and treats it as outside its recovery authority |
| 5 — Corporate/administrative | Deferred; staff redirected to support clinical continuity activity where practicable |

Continuity strategies for Tier 1 and 2 services depend on clinical staff being current in downtime procedures. This is a training and awareness dependency shared with [../09-Security-Operations](../09-Security-Operations/README.md) and [../05-Governance/052-roles_and_responsibilities](../05-Governance/052-roles_and_responsibilities.md), not a business continuity–specific control, and its currency is not yet independently verified (§7).

Invocation authority sits with the Business Continuity Manager, who may act on their own judgement or on escalation from the CISO under the incident response escalation path ([081-incident_response_plan](../08-Incident-Management/081-incident_response_plan.md) §7). Where the triggering event is a cyber incident, this plan runs in parallel with — not instead of — the incident response process; the CISO retains ownership of containment and eradication while the Business Continuity Manager owns continuity of service.



# 6. Roles and Responsibilities

Roles build on the RACI already defined in [../05-Governance/052-roles_and_responsibilities](../05-Governance/052-roles_and_responsibilities.md) §4 and the CR-010 treatment ownership in [../04-Risk-Management/046-risk_treatment_plans](../04-Risk-Management/046-risk_treatment_plans.md) §3; this plan operationalises rather than redefines them.

| Role | Business Continuity Function |
|---|---|
| Business Continuity Manager | Owns this plan; invokes and stands down BC arrangements; owner of CR-010 treatment actions |
| Chief Digital Information Officer (CDIO) | Coordinates clinical and operational recovery priorities; interface between clinical services and IT recovery ([081-incident_response_plan](../08-Incident-Management/081-incident_response_plan.md) §4) |
| Clinical Safety Officer | Confirms downtime procedures are safely in effect; advises on when elective activity can resume |
| Infrastructure Manager | Executes technical recovery per [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md); reports recovery progress against Tier MTPDs |
| CISO | Retains ownership of any concurrent cyber incident response; keeps Business Continuity Manager informed of containment status affecting recovery timing |
| SIRO | Accountable for BC invocation being appropriate and proportionate; informed per §5 |
| Cyber Security Governance Group (CSGG) | Informed of invocation; reviews BC performance as a standing item where the trigger was cyber-related |

No dedicated Business Continuity function currently sits on the CSGG membership list in [052-roles_and_responsibilities](../05-Governance/052-roles_and_responsibilities.md) §3; adding the Business Continuity Manager (or a delegate) to CSGG membership would close that coordination gap and is recorded as a recommendation in §9.



# 7. Testing and Exercising

[082-ransomware_tabletop_exercise](../08-Incident-Management/082-ransomware_tabletop_exercise.md) §2 explicitly scoped out "a live technical failover to backup systems," and its Inject 4 exercised only the clinical communication aspects of an EPR outage, not a full BC invocation under this plan. No dedicated business continuity exercise has yet been run. This is consistent with CAF D1/D2 being rated **Partially Achieved** rather than Achieved ([022-caf_assessment](../03-Current-State-Assessment/022-caf_assessment.md) §3), and with REC-006 in that assessment, which calls for a formal testing and lessons-learned cadence for this plan and the Incident Response Plan.

Until a dedicated exercise is run, WHT cannot yet evidence that clinical staff downtime-procedure familiarity (§4) or the invocation process (§5) work as designed under real conditions; §4 and §5 should be read as the designed process, not a tested one.



# 8. Review and Maintenance

This plan is reviewed annually by the Business Continuity Manager, and after any invocation (§5) or exercise (§7), with findings reported to the CSGG per [051-security_strategy](../05-Governance/051-security_strategy.md) §6. It is maintained alongside [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md), and both should be updated together where a change to one affects the assumptions of the other — for example, a change to a Tier's MTPD in §3 should be reflected in the corresponding RTO in [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md) §3.



# 9. Recommendations

| Recommendation ID | Recommendation | Priority | Owner | Target Timeframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REC-001 | Run a dedicated business continuity exercise (not only a cyber tabletop) covering at least one Tier 1 service, to validate §4 and §5 under realistic conditions | High | Business Continuity Manager | Q4 2026 |
| REC-002 | Add the Business Continuity Manager (or a nominated delegate) to CSGG membership so BC and cyber governance are coordinated at the same forum | Medium | CISO / Business Continuity Manager | Q3 2026 |
| REC-003 | Establish a recurring (at minimum annual) review of clinical staff familiarity with downtime procedures for Tier 1/2 services | Medium | Clinical Safety Officer | Q1 2027 |
| REC-004 | Formally verify the Tier 3 infrastructure MTPD assumption in §3 against actual [102-disaster_recovery_plan](102-disaster_recovery_plan.md) RTOs once that plan's REC-002 (recurring backup/DR test schedule) is delivered | Medium | Infrastructure Manager | Aligned to DR plan's target |



# 10. Conclusion

WHT has a defined business impact analysis, tiered continuity strategy, and invocation process for its most safety-critical services. The material gap is testing: no full BC exercise has been run, so the plan's design has not yet been evidenced under realistic conditions, and clinical downtime-procedure readiness is assumed rather than verified. This is consistent with — and a direct contributor to — the CAF D1/D2 Partially Achieved rating, and closing it is the highest-leverage next step for this plan.
