# 1. Purpose

The Cyber Risk Register provides a structured approach for identifying, assessing, treating, and monitoring cybersecurity risks affecting Westbridge Hospitals Trust.

The register supports:

- Executive risk reporting.
- Regulatory compliance.
- Cybersecurity governance.
- Risk treatment planning.
- Audit assurance.
- Continuous improvement.

---

# 2. Risk Ownership Model

Cyber risk ownership follows the principle that:

> "The person accountable for the business service or information asset owns the associated risk."

The Cyber Security Team provides:

- Risk assessment expertise.
- Security recommendations.
- Threat intelligence.
- Control guidance.
- Risk monitoring.

However, business and clinical owners remain accountable for accepting and managing risks affecting their services.

# 3. Risk Rating Methodology

## Likelihood Scale

| Score | Rating | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rare | Unlikely to occur |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could occur occasionally |
| 3 | Possible | Realistic possibility |
| 4 | Likely | Expected to occur |
| 5 | Almost Certain | Highly probable |

---

## Impact Scale

| Score | Rating | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Insignificant | Minimal operational impact |
| 2 | Minor | Limited disruption |
| 3 | Moderate | Service impact requiring management attention |
| 4 | Major | Significant operational or regulatory impact |
| 5 | Severe | Patient safety or major organisational impact |

---

## Risk Score

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

| Score | Risk Level | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | Low | Monitor |
| 5-9 | Medium | Manage through normal processes |
| 10-16 | High | Treatment required |
| 17-25 | Critical | Immediate action required |
