# Critical Asset Summary

**Organisation:** Westbridge Hospitals Trust (WHT)
**Document Type:** Critical Asset Summary (Derived Extract)
**Owner:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
**Classification:** Portfolio Case Study – Fictional Organisation
**Version:** 1.0

# 1. Purpose

This document summarises the assets rated **Critical** business criticality in the authoritative asset inventory, [022-master_assets_register.xlsx](022-master_assets_register.xlsx). It is a derived extract for quick reference in risk, resilience, and incident response discussions — not a second source of truth. Any discrepancy between this summary and the register should be resolved in favour of the register.

18 of the 35 assets in the register (AST-001 to AST-035) are rated Critical, reflecting their direct link to patient safety, clinical service continuity, or the confidentiality of highly sensitive information, consistent with the Trust's risk appetite set out in [../01-Discovery/003-business-context](../01-Discovery/003-business-context.md).

# 3. Why These Assets Matter

- **Clinical systems** (AST-001 to AST-005) directly support diagnosis, treatment, and medication safety — loss of availability has an immediate patient safety impact.
- **Infrastructure** (AST-015 to AST-018) underpins every other system in the estate; compromise or outage has the broadest blast radius across the Trust.
- **Medical devices** (AST-020 to AST-022) are connected to clinical networks and directly involved in patient diagnosis and monitoring, and include devices identified as running unsupported operating systems (see [024-medical_device_register.xlsx](024-medical_device_register.xlsx)).
- **Data assets** (AST-023 to AST-025) represent the highly sensitive patient information the Trust is obligated to protect under UK GDPR, the NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT), and its duty of confidentiality to patients.
- **Identity and access** (AST-029, AST-030) are the control point for all other access in the estate — compromise of Entra ID or privileged accounts would enable broad, cross-system impact.
- **NHS Digital Services** (AST-032) provides national connectivity (e.g. Spine, PDS, e-Referral Service) that clinical workflows depend on and that the Trust does not directly control.
