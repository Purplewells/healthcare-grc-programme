## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the cyber security governance roles across WHT and their accountabilities, and sets out the Terms of Reference for the Cyber Security Governance Group (CSGG) chartered in [051-security_strategy](051-security_strategy.md) §4. It translates the stakeholder register in [../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders](../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders.md) into operational governance accountability.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers executive and governance-level roles with cyber security accountability, the CSGG's terms of reference, and a RACI matrix for the programme's key recurring cyber security activities. It does not restate the full stakeholder register — see [../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders](../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders.md) for the complete stakeholder landscape, including clinical, operational, and supplier stakeholders not directly accountable for governance decisions.

**Standing agenda:** As set out in [051-security_strategy](051-security_strategy.md) §4.2.

**Secretariat:** Provided by the Cyber Security Team; minutes and actions are logged and tracked to closure between meetings.

## 5. Review & Maintenance

This document is reviewed annually by the CSGG, and whenever a role in §2 changes ownership or the CSGG's terms of reference in §3 are amended. Updates must be reflected consistently in [051-security_strategy](051-security_strategy.md) §4.1 and in [../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders](../01-Discovery/006-stakeholders.md), which remains the authoritative source for the full stakeholder landscape.
